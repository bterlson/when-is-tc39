## When Is TC39?

[whenistc39.com](http://whenistc39.com) periodically updates a static website based on when the next TC39 meeting is. The next agenda is parsed from GitHub and rendered into a template (`template.html` in the root).

### Making Updates

* **Changing the template**: To change the static text displayed on the site, edit `template.md`.
* **Adding more info**": Agenda parsing is in `UpdateFromGithub/index.js`. Have at it!
